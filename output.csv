Dodd Frank Manager,This role was initially created to have a manager review all DF attributes which were entered as per the client’s DF compliance method (Swaps App, Markit, IECA or Chatham Agmt).  It was found to be redundant because the COB managers were performing the same task and are the same people.  The delay caused by having to find another manager to approve a task which had already been reviewed resulted in the removal of this approval from the work-flow.  However, this role must remain in the system because any entity added in Fenergo prior to October 19, 2015 (~ <LE 350) remains on the old workflow and must be approved by a DF Manager, as such.,'"Rolegroup_Entitlement.CONTAINS_ALL{{"Dodd Frank Manager_Fenergo View","Dodd Frank Manager_Review and Approval","Dodd Frank Manager_Dodd Frank Override""',Fenergo
